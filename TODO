Things TO DO:

	1. Assets have related_links - some are other Assets, some are RemoteAssets
	2. Assets have related_promos which I THINK are other assets.
    3. Assets have parent_tree which points to another object...

Relationships
	
	I need to follow each object to see how far the rabbit hole goes.

	Ideally each object should have a checkbox that will "follow" related objects and ingest them if necessary.
